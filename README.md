 Task 2: Make a http endpoint using any one of the python web frameworks – FastAPI or Flask or Django.

 This FastAPI application provides an API endpoint for computing financial data volatility. You can either upload a CSV file or provide a directory path containing multiple CSV files. Here I have uploaded csv file. The API calculates both daily and annualized volatility based on the financial data.
